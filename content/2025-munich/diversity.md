## Scholarships + Travel Funding

The Dan Kohn Scholarship + Travel Fund is intended to enable open source developers and community members to attend events that they would otherwise be unable to attend due to a lack of funding. We place an emphasis on funding applicants who are from historically underrepresented or untapped groups and/or those of lower socioeconomic status. If you work for a company that has the ability to fund your travel, we ask that you not apply, to save funds for those that need it.

Fill out the form using the button below to have your funding request considered. In order to maximize spending, travel fund assistance may only be used for: Coach airfare tickets, accommodation for the dates of the event plus one night prior to the event start date, ground transportation to/from the airport. Funds may not be used for miscellaneous travel expenses including food, visa costs, non-airport transportation, baggage fees, etc.

A standard in-person ticket for the PromCon EU 2025 will be included.

Receipt of Travel Funding does not guarantee entry to the event.  Recipients need to adhere to The Linux Foundation COVID-19 rules and regulations. If the recipient does not meet COVID-19 requirements for the event, the travel fund allotted is null and void. Should the recipient not be able to travel due to COVID-19 and travel has already been booked, the recipient will need to work with airlines and hotels to receive a refund. If a refund is not a possibility, The Linux Foundation will reimburse for incurred travel expenses within the allotted amount.
