## Become a sponsor

As a community conference with a low entrance fee, we depend on sponsors for
making PromCon possible.

Do you want to help make this happen and **get your company featured in videos,
banners, and printed materials?**

## I want to sponsor PromCon. What do I do?

Please see the **<a href="/assets/sponsor-promcon-2020_03022020.pdf">PromCon NA 2020 sponsorship prospectus</a>** or email [CNCF](mailto:sponsor@cncf.io).

If you wish to take advantage of swag distribution, booth space, or free
attendee tickets, please let us know in advance.

## Why sponsor PromCon?

Prometheus is a leading open-source monitoring system and time series database
which is used by companies of all sizes for their mission-critical monitoring.

PromCon attracts a crowd of experienced and influential
infrastructure engineers, both via in-person attendance and through video
recordings that are made available to the public after the conference.
**Featuring your name and brand in front of this audience will drive the
adoption of your products and services in the infrastructure world, as well as
present you with potential hiring opportunities!** And of course, if your
organisation is using Prometheus already, you will benefit directly from helping
its community to grow and thrive.


## How will the money be used?

We will use the sponsorship money to pay for conference expenses such as:

* Professional video recordings of all talks
* Catering for all attendees
* Printed materials, banners, lanyards, etc.
* Evening after-party (unless sponsored separately)
* Speaker reimbursements, if funding allows for it
* Diversity scholarships
