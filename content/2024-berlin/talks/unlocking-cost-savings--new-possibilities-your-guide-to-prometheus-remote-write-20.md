## Unlocking Cost Savings & New Possibilities: Your Guide to Prometheus Remote Write 2.0

Speaker(s): [Alex Greenbank](../../speakers/alex-greenbank) & [Bartłomiej Płotka](../../speakers/bartłomiej-płotka)

Prometheus Remote Write is the protocol used to send Prometheus metrics from Prometheus or any other metric source to compatible remote storage endpoints such as Thanos and Cortex. Remote Write is generally used for metric long term storage, centralization, and cloud services. It also enables users to run Prometheus in an agent mode, reducing local storage requirements.

Welcome to Remote Write 2.0! In this talk, Bartek and Alex, Prometheus maintainers and RW2.0 spec. co-authors, will introduce you to the next iteration of the popular protocol which adds more functionality while cutting your egress costs up to 60%, and keeps the previous versions easy-to-implement stateless design!

The audience will learn what's changed in the second version of Remote Write, what it unlocks, and how easy it is to update or adopt. Finally, the speakers will share the latest benchmarks and relation to the alternatives like OpenTelemetry's OTLP.
