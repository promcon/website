## Prometheus Java Client 1.0.0

Speaker(s): [Fabian Stäber](../../speakers/fabian-staber)

At last year's PromCon we presented a lightning talk announcing a complete re-write of the Prometheus Java client library. Meanwhile the first releases are out (\*), and we are proud to present the results: Native histogram support, awesome performance benchmarks, extensive runtime configuration options, automatic Exemplars for various tracing libraries, Exemplar markers for trace sampling, integration with OpenTelemetry metrics, and more.

We will present the current status, migration path, and future plans.
