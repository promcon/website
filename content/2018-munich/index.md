## Overview

PromCon 2018 is the third conference dedicated to the
[Prometheus monitoring system](https://prometheus.io/). It will take place
August 9 & 10 (Thu & Fri)
at Google Munich as a single-track event with space for 220 attendees.

PromCon aims to connect Prometheus users and developers from around the world in
order to exchange knowledge, best practices, and experience gained around using
Prometheus. We also want to collaborate to build a community and grow
professional connections around systems and service monitoring.
