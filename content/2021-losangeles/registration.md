## Note to event participants on email scams to purchase attendee lists

There has been a growing number of emails going out claiming to sell the attendee list for this event. We never sell attendee lists or contact information, nor do we authorize others to do so. Anyone claiming to be authorized to do so is fraudulent. At this time we have no reason to believe that they have obtained the attendee list, which we never publicly share for exactly this reason. If you receive an email claiming to sell an attendee list for this event, it is fraudulent.

## COVID-19 vaccination policy

Our attendees’ health and safety remains our top priority as we continue to monitor COVID-19 and look to the venue, local, state, CDC, and WHO guidelines to make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements.

The short version is that scientific consensus in general and vaccines in particular are not up for debate. The long version can be found on the [KubeCon + CloudNative North America website](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/attend/health-and-safety/).
