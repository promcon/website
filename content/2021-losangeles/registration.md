## Group discounts

If you have a group of 5 or more people, you can receive a 10% discount on all passes. All pass types must be the same, and all registrations must be processed under one group registration and must be paid with the same credit card. To create a group, select “Add Another Person” to your registration. When 5 or more people are added the 10% discount will be automatically applied. Please note: this discount may not be combined with any additional discounts. Please contact events@cncf.io for any questions.

## Cancellations and substitutions

If you must cancel for any reason, please log back into your registration, click the “Register/Modify” button, and select “Unregister.” If you need further assistance, email at events@cncf.io.

If you would like to substitute another attendee in lieu of cancellation, return to the registration form, log in as “Already Registered,” and edit the registration with the new attendee’s information. Utilizing this feature will also allow you to re-issue yourself a receipt and/or confirmation should you need it.

## Note to event participants on email scams to purchase attendee lists

There has been a growing number of emails going out claiming to sell the attendee list for this event. We never sell attendee lists or contact information, nor do we authorize others to do so. Anyone claiming to be authorized to do so is fraudulent. At this time we have no reason to believe that they have obtained the attendee list, which we never publicly share for exactly this reason. If you receive an email claiming to sell an attendee list for this event, it is fraudulent.

## COVID-19 vaccination policy

Our attendees’ health and safety remains our top priority as we continue to monitor COVID-19 and look to the venue, local, state, CDC, and WHO guidelines to make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements.

The short version is that scientific consensus in general and vaccines in particular are not up for debate. The long version can be found on the [KubeCon + CloudNative North America website](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/attend/health-and-safety/).
