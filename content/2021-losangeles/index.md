## Overview

PromCon North America 2021 is the seventh installment of the PromCon conference dedicated to the [Prometheus monitoring system](https://prometheus.io/). The conference will be presented as a hybrid event - attendees can join and participate in person or virtually. It will take place on Monday, October 11, 2021, as a colocated event at [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/).

PromCon aims to connect Prometheus users and developers from around the world in order to exchange knowledge, best practices, and experience gained around using Prometheus. We also want to collaborate to build a community and grow professional connections around systems and service monitoring.

## Note to event participants on email scams to purchase attendee lists

There has been a growing number of emails going out claiming to sell the attendee list for this event. We never sell attendee lists or contact information, nor do we authorize others to do so. Anyone claiming to be authorized to do so is fraudulent. At this time we have no reason to believe that they have obtained the attendee list, which we never publicly share for exactly this reason. If you receive an email claiming to sell an attendee list for this event, it is fraudulent.
