## Submit a talk

The PromCon Call for Papers (CfP) is open for talk submissions until 23:59 UTC on
Wednesday, July 31st, 2019, and we encourage you to submit a talk!

  <i class="fa fa-commenting"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Submit Talk
</a>

We are accepting talk proposals around the following topics, with experience
levels ranging from beginner to expert:

* Integrating with Prometheus
* Using Prometheus
* Prometheus use case reports
* Prometheus fundamentals and philosophy
* Prometheus internals and core development

**Speaker reimbursements:** Since PromCon is a non-commercial community
conference, speaker reimbursements for travel and accommodation will depend on
available funding. If you want to give a talk but cannot get reimbursed by your
company, please submit a proposal anyway and let us know in the "Additional note
to the selection committee" field. We will then let you know what we can offer.

**Diversity:** For diversity speakers, we will try extra hard to find a way to
help with travel and/or accommodation. No promises made, but we will honestly
try to make it work.
