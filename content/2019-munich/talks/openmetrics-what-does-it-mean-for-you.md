## OpenMetrics: What Does It Mean for You

Speaker: [Brian Brazil](/2019-munich/speakers/Brian Brazil/)

The OpenMetrics format intends to standardise metric exposition, making it easy for both those developing and operating systems to monitor them. It is however a new format. Will it be supported by your monitoring system? Will you need to rewrite your existing instrumentation? What's needed to transition? What about 3rd party systems you don't control? How does this differ and expand, and improve on the existing Prometheus format?  This session will cover all of these questions.
