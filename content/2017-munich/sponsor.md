## Why sponsor PromCon?

Prometheus is a leading open-source monitoring system and time series database
which is used by companies of all sizes for their mission-critical monitoring.

PromCon attracts a crowd of experienced and influential
infrastructure engineers, both via in-person attendance and through video
recordings that are made available to the public after the conference.
**Featuring your name and brand in front of this audience will drive the
adoption of your products and services in the infrastructure world, as well as
present you with potential hiring opportunities!** And of course, if your
organisation is using Prometheus already, you will benefit directly from helping
its community to grow and thrive.

To give you an idea of the overall buzz in the Prometheus ecosystem, in March
2017, we counted:

* 11,000+ total GitHub stars across our repositories
* 550+ contributors
* 3900+ pull requests (120+ open)
* 2500+ issues (600+ open)
* 400+ people in our IRC channel (#prometheus on FreeNode)
* 700+ people on the mailing list who have created 1200+ threads
* 150+ Prometheus-related talks and workshops
* 300+ articles and blog posts
* 100+ 3rd party integrations

There are several Fortune 500 companies using Prometheus, as well as some of the
tech world’s most influential movers and shakers.

You can find a small selection of companies using Prometheus on
https://prometheus.io/.

## How will the money be used?

We will use the sponsorship money to pay for conference expenses such as:

* Professional video recordings of all talks
* Catering for all attendees
* Printed materials, banners, lanyards, etc.
* Evening after-party (unless sponsored separately)
* Speaker reimbursements, if funding allows for it
* Diversity scholarships

PromCon is a community-organized conference with no financial profit motive. Any
leftover funds will be used to make the conference better for everyone.
