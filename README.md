# PromCon Website - AN AMAZING PROJECT

This repository contains both the content and the static-site generator code for the
PromCon website.

## Prerequisites

You need to have a working Ruby environment set up and then install the
necessary gems:

```bash
cd docs
bundle
```

## Building

To generate the static site, run:

```bash
bundle exec nanoc
```

The resulting static site will be stored in the `output` directory.

## Development Server

To run a local server that displays the generated site, run:

```bash
# Rebuild the site whenever relevant files change:
bundle exec guard
# Start the local development server:
bundle exec nanoc view
```

You should now be able to view the generated site at
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000).
